## RIAN Power Platform Connector
The Querent’s Real-Time Information Aggregation Network (RIAN) solution transforms large private data workloads into a Data Fabric - a compact, graph based representation. This connector ingests data from data source(s) to enable knowledge discovery by creating linkages between data for insights, such as similarity searches and graph-based statistics.

## Publisher: Querent AI LLC

## Prerequisites

- A self-hosted RIAN instance running on a Docker container or a Kubernetes cluster on the user’s infrastructure.

## Supported Operations  

1. **Configure Data Collection**:  
   Set up collectors to ingest data from sources such as local folders, email, real-time data streams, and cloud storage.  

2. **Data Handling**:  
   Read and process data from multiple file formats, including txt, json, xml, html, ppt, doc, pptx, and more.  

3. **Insight Generation**:  
   Perform similarity searches, graph-based statistics, and discover hidden relationships within the Data Fabric. 



## Known Issues and Limitations  
- No internet transmission: All data processing occurs within the user’s infrastructure, ensuring privacy but requiring local resources.  
- Insight generation is limited to the capabilities of the deployed RIAN version.
